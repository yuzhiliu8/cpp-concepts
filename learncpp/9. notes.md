# Ch.0 learncpp Error Handling and Testing 

### Code Coverage
- aim for 100% branch coverage
    - if statements --> 2+ branches (one for each if/else if/else block)
- loop coverage:
    - loops should work for 0 iterations, 1 iteration and 2 iterations
    - working for 2 usually implies works for 2+ iterations

### Error handling
- Handle error within function
- pass the error up the stack for the user to handle
- Halt program
- throw an exception


- Silent failure: function does nothing. Adding logs is helpful so user knows if smthn went wrong. Is usually hard if the function needs to return a value
- For functions that return smthn like a bool, using a values that isn't in the possible range can mean different errors occurred. (such as -1 when the range is non negative numbers like an index)
- If the function can return all possible values, then use something like `std::optional`
