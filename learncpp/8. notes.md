# Ch8 learncpp - control flow

### `if constexpr`
```cpp
if constexpr (conditional) {

} else {

}
```
- if the conditional can be evaluated at compile time, use if constexpr
- the compiler will evaluate it and only keep the useful branch
- good for templates, since template functions are evaluated at compile time

### switch statements
```cpp
switch (x)
    {
    case 1:
        std::cout << "One";
        return;
    case 2:
        std::cout << "Two";
        return;
    case 3:
        std::cout << "Three";
        return;
    default:
        std::cout << "Unknown";
        return;
    }
```
- the condition in the switch must evaluate to integral or enumerated type
- For a long sequence of if statements, the program sequentially evaluates each condition (generally O(n))
- For a switch statement, the compiler often uses a jump table for case lookups, which behaves like a O(1) lookup table at runtime
    - `case` labels
    - `default` label
    - `break` or `return` at the end of each case, or else you get switch fallthrough
    - simple pattern matching
    - labels do not create a new scope by default, every case label shares the switch block scope

#### Goto statements
- can use label and goto w/ function scope
- avoid this
### Do While
- prefer while loops

### Halting
- std::exit() (implicity called at end of main)
    - use std::quick_exit() for multithreaded, since it won't clean up static variables that other threads might need
- std::abort() - abnormal termination
- std::terminate() - called implicitly when exception isn't handled
    - terminate calls std::abort by default

### Random Number Generation
- Most common/simple alg for C++ is Mersenne Twister
- include random to initialize mt19937
    - Only can generate 32 bit unsigned ints
- need to pass into defined distribution w/ ranges
- seed it properly
    - can seed with system clock
    - or seed with `std::random_device` (asks OS) <-- best
